this code is one of the worst codes ever made (& the worst for me )

on .js{
on this code i used many conditions and loops that's are so useless (really useless);
there are many functions that's useless (like useless() (XD ":)" )  );
i made many coditions and loops that i could easily not using them;
}

on .css{
.i just tryed to type as many as i can't 

}
on <html>
 i just tried to make every thing simple and work normally <-- ofc it's joke-->
i  just put <style> css code</style> then i used <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
